# TypeWeather

TypeWeather is a weather forecasting application developed as a bonus project for Rocketseat's explorer certificates. Originally written in JavaScript (JS), it has been revamped in TypeScript (TS) to boost code robustness, scalability, and maintainability. This transition leverages the advantages offered by TypeScript for a more resilient and sustainable codebase.
